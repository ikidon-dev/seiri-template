# Declare interface TemplateNodeJS<T> extends CleanCode

This is a small project that I am building while trying to understand and interpret the following books:

- **Clean Architecture**: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design
- **Clean Code**: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship.
- **The Clean Coder**: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers.
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software.
- **Design Patterns**: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software.
